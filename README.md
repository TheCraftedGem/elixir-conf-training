# Section 2 Example

There are 2 different parts in this example. Each part has its own set of branches to walk you through the
changes necessary to implement a Phoenix Channels server and client.

## Part 1

Checkout `part1-start` in order to get started with this example. Do not look at the commit log or you will
give away the exercise to yourself (and you wouldn't want to do that, would you?)

There are instructions to follow for both the main class flow, but then with an additional hard mode.

The answers can be found in `part1-complete`. If you are struggling at all, raise your hand rather than
directly looking ahead. The hard mode solution can be found in `part1-complete-hard`, due to the amount of
changes necessary to implement.

## Part 2

Checkout `part2-start` in order to get started with this example. Do not look at the commit log or you will
give away the exercise to yourself (and you wouldn't want to do that, would you?)

There are instructions to follow for both the main class flow, but then with an additional hard mode.

The answers can be found in `part2-complete`. If you are struggling at all, raise your hand rather than
directly looking ahead. The hard mode solution can be found in `part2-complete-hard`, due to the amount of
changes necessary to implement.
